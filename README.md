# MosquitoAlert-Challenge-2023

Mosquito-borne diseases pose a persistent global health threat, necessitating innovative approaches for accurate mosquito species identification and surveillance. This paper presents a deep-learning solution to address this challenge. The paper commences with a detailed problem background, highlighting the significance of accurate identification in disease control efforts. The experiment setup encompasses dataset preparation, model architecture, and training stages, including feature extraction (transfer learning) and fine-tuning. Hyperparameters are finely tuned to optimize performance, while model evaluation sheds light on its effectiveness. Results showcase the performance of the model in classifying diverse mosquito species, both in feature extraction and fine-tuning stages. A comprehensive test data evaluation further emphasizes its capabilities. This work signifies the potential of deep learning in public health and entomology, paving the way for practical applications in mosquito surveillance.
